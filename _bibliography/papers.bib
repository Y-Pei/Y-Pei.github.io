  abstract="<strong>Purpose</strong><br>
            Genome sequencing (GS) for diagnosis of rare genetic disease is being introduced into the clinic, but the complexity of the data poses challenges for developing pipelines with high diagnostic sensitivity. We evaluated the performance of the Genomics England 100,000 Genomes Project (100kGP) panel-based pipelines, using craniosynostosis as a test disease.<br><br>
            <strong>Methods</strong><br>
            GS data from 114 probands with craniosynostosis and their relatives (314 samples), negative on routine genetic testing, were scrutinized by a specialized research team, and diagnoses compared with those made by 100kGP.<br><br>
            <strong>Results</strong><br>
            Sixteen likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants were identified by 100kGP. Eighteen additional likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants were identified by the research team, indicating that for craniosynostosis, 100kGP panels had a diagnostic sensitivity of only 47%. Measures that could have augmented diagnoses were improved calling of existing panel genes (+18% sensitivity), review of updated panels (+12%), comprehensive analysis of de novo small variants (+29%), and copy-number/structural variants (+9%). Recent NHS England recommendations that partially incorporate these measures should achieve 85% overall sensitivity (+38%).<br><br>
            <strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
            GS identified likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants in 29.8% of previously undiagnosed patients with craniosynostosis. This demonstrates the value of research analysis and the importance of continually improving algorithms to maximize the potential of clinical GS.",

  title={Clinical and genetic heterogeneity in Melkersson-Rosenthal Syndrome},
  author={Pei, Yang and Beaman, Glenda M and Mansfield, David and Clayton-Smith, Jill and Stewart, Murray and Newman, William G},
  abstract={Melkersson Rosenthal syndromes (MRS) is a rare autosomal dominantly inherited neurocutaneous syndrome characterised by a triad of facial (seventh cranial) nerve palsy, recurrent orofacial swelling and fissuring of the tongue. A recent report implicated a heterozygous missense variant in SLC27A1 (FATP1) as the cause of this condition in members of an affected Chinese family. We undertook Sanger sequencing of this gene in 14 affected unrelated individuals affected by MRS. We did not detect any putative pathogenic variants. Our data indicates that there is both clinical and genetic heterogeneity in this condition and that the causative gene remains to be identified for the majority of cases.},

  title={A Comparison of Structural Variant Calling from Short-Read and Nanopore-Based Whole-Genome Sequencing Using Optical Genome Mapping as a Benchmark},
  author={Pei, Yang and Tanguy, Melanie and Giess, Adam and Dixit, Abhijit and Wilson, Louise C and Gibbons, Richard J and Twigg, Stephen RF and Elgar, Greg and Wilkie, Andrew OM},
  abstract={The identification of structural variants (SVs) in genomic data represents an ongoing challenge because of difficulties in reliable SV calling leading to reduced sensitivity and specificity. We prepared high-quality DNA from 9 parent–child trios, who had previously undergone short-read whole-genome sequencing (Illumina platform) as part of the Genomics England 100,000 Genomes Project. We reanalysed the genomes using both Bionano optical genome mapping (OGM; 8 probands and one trio) and Nanopore long-read sequencing (Oxford Nanopore Technologies [ONT] platform; all samples). To establish a “truth” dataset, we asked whether rare proband SV calls (n = 234) made by the Bionano Access (version 1.6.1)/Solve software (version 3.6.1_11162020) could be verified by individual visualisation using the Integrative Genomics Viewer with either or both of the Illumina and ONT raw sequence. Of these, 222 calls were verified, indicating that Bionano OGM calls have high precision (positive predictive value 95%). We then asked what proportion of the 222 true Bionano SVs had been identified by SV callers in the other two datasets. In the Illumina dataset, sensitivity varied according to variant type, being high for deletions (115/134; 86%) but poor for insertions (13/58; 22%). In the ONT dataset, sensitivity was generally poor using the original Sniffles variant caller (48% overall) but improved substantially with use of Sniffles2 (36/40; 90% and 17/23; 74% for deletions and insertions, respectively). In summary, we show that the precision of OGM is very high. In addition, when applying the Sniffles2 caller, the sensitivity of SV calling using ONT long-read sequence data outperforms Illumina sequencing for most SV types.},
