I am a bioinformatician working with Prof. Goriely on "selfish" mutations and triplet repeat expansion. My  projects focus on analysing ultra-deep short/long read sequencing data aiming to identify ultra-low level mutations in germline tissues.

Previously, I was a DPhil Medical Sciences student supervised by Prof. Andrew Wilkie and Prof. Stephen Twigg. My research involved characterising structural variants (SVs) in patients with craniosynostosis using various genomic and molecular approaches, including Illumina/Nanopore whole genome sequencing and Bionano Optical Genome Mapping (OGM).

I also hold an MPhil in Genomic Medicine from the University of Cambridge and an MSci in Biochemistry from the University of Manchester. My previous research projects include "Characterising germline variants in renal cell carcinoma using whole genome sequencing" and "Identifying the causative genes in Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome through whole exome sequencing."
